# Advent of Code 2025

#### Programming Language: **C**

---

Last year I gave AoC a decent shot with a totally new programming language (for me). While I only made it through the first few days, I have spent more time with C/C++ over the last year. I am hoping to make it much farther with this year's AoC.

My focus for this year's attempt is to do it in **C**. I have much less experience now in C as opposed to C++, but I want to improve and start to do a lot more projects using C (given that I like doing embedded stuff it's basically a requirement), so this is a great way to have fun getting better
